# Calculator App - Android Development

This is my first Android application built during the course of Android Development. The app is a simple calculator, developed using **Jetpack Compose** and **Kotlin**. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- User-friendly interface built using Jetpack Compose
- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- Clear (`C`) and backspace (`←`) functionality
- Supports multiple calculations in a session

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of the app in action:

4. **Run the app** on an emulator or a physical Android device.

## Usage

After launching the app, you can perform basic arithmetic operations. The following operations are supported:

- **Addition** (`+`)
- **Subtraction** (`-`)
- **Multiplication** (`*`)
- **Division** (`/`)
- **Clear** (`C`) to reset the input
- **Backspace** (`←`) to remove the last character
